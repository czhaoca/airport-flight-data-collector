## Technical Architecture

### Design Decisions

#### 1. **SOLID Architecture**
**Decision**: Implement SOLID principles throughout the codebase.

**Rationale**:
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to understand and modify
- **Testability**: Dependency injection enables comprehensive unit testing
- **Extensibility**: New airports and storage backends can be added without modifying existing code
- **Team Scalability**: Multiple developers can work on different components independently

**Implementation**:
- Interfaces define contracts (`IDataCollector`, `IStorageService`, `IHttpClient`)
- Dependency injection via `ServiceContainer`
- Base classes for common functionality
- Single responsibility for each class

#### 2. **Database Selection**
**Decision**: Support multiple database providers with local files as default.

**Rationale**:
- **Low Barrier to Entry**: Users can start immediately with local storage
- **Scalability Path**: Easy upgrade to cloud databases as needs grow
- **Flexibility**: Different use cases require different storage solutions
- **Cost Optimization**: Free tiers sufficient for most users

**Providers Chosen**:
- **Local Files**: Zero setup, Git-friendly, perfect for development
- **Cloudflare D1**: Edge deployment, serverless, good free tier (5GB)
- **Oracle Cloud**: Enterprise features, large free tier (2×20GB), full SQL

#### 3. **HTTP Client Strategy**
**Decision**: Multiple HTTP client implementations with runtime selection.

**Rationale**:
- **Bot Protection**: Some airports block automated requests
- **Flexibility**: Different clients work better for different scenarios
- **Fallback Options**: Can switch clients if one fails

**Implementations**:
- **Node Fetch**: Default, lightweight, built into Node.js 18+
- **Curl**: Better bot protection handling, uses system curl
- **Puppeteer**: Full browser automation for heavy protection

#### 4. **Error Handling Philosophy**
**Decision**: Fail gracefully with detailed context and recovery options.

**Rationale**:
- **Reliability**: System should continue operating despite failures
- **Debuggability**: Detailed error context speeds up troubleshooting
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages help users self-diagnose

**Implementation**:
- Custom error types (`CollectionError`, `NetworkError`, `ValidationError`)
- Error context with metadata
- Retry strategies for transient failures
- Graceful degradation

#### 5. **Configuration Management**
**Decision**: Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults.

**Rationale**:
- **Flexibility**: Different settings for dev/staging/production
- **Security**: Sensitive data in environment variables, not code
- **Ease of Use**: Works out-of-the-box with defaults
- **12-Factor App**: Following cloud-native best practices
